Project for a web-development training course
Numeric Puzzle

About this project

This group project it is actually a homework for a Web-Development Course, we - Cristi, Adi and Ale - are trying to complete by the end of the course. It consists in creating three puzzles with numbers and in answering a short quiz.

Our numeric puzzles

We have created 3 puzzles, that follow the same logic, one with 9 pieces, another one with 16 pieces and another one with 25 pieces. Simply by clicking numbers around the empty cell, you can move them inside the empty cell, one by one. The idea is to order them inside the table.

Quiz

Here we have tried to create a simple quiz related to numbers, a quiz that can be checked by clicking a button.


P.S. In doing this group project we used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, mySQL.
